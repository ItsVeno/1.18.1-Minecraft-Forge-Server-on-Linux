# 1.18.1-Minecraft-Forge-Server-on-Linux

This is my first time creating a Minecraft Forge Server on Linux, so in my research of how to do it, I have found much confusion on how to run the server. This is due to the fact that Forge used to be ran using a `.jar` file, but this is not the case anymore. All of the tutorials I see are pre `1.18.1` and do not show how to run the server with the new file for linux, which is a `.sh` file. I am going to go through step by step to show you how to install a brand new 1.18.1 Minecraft Forge Server on Linux. Note: I am using a 64-bit Debian distribution of Linux, but I believe this works for every version of linux.
